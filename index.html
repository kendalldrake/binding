        <p class="drop-cap">My primary text that sets the tone for my website is a blog called <em>Clatter of the Snow Queen</em> by Natalia Ilyin. The blog is about the difficulties that are synonymous with being an artist or designer in contemporary culture, due to the social constructs of perfection. The narrative goes on to explain how postmodern society has engrained within us an expectation that anything we do or create as an artist is just not good enough. We get broken down, piece by piece through harsh critique, most of which is validated by a set of rules, delivered by a panel of individuals who are governed by an inflexible culture. This culture is the reason why we often push ourselves to the brink of collapse, in an effort to achieve the impossible. I then went on to choose two more articles that resonate with the theme of criticism and judgement. The articles I chose were <em>Judgement and Beauty</em>, by Yoon Soo Lee, 2016 and <em>The Programmed Designer</em>, by John-Patrick Hartnett, 2017. Lee’s memoir addresses the distressing effects of judgement and beauty that’s been engrained in Korean culture and formed part of their value system. She goes on to explain how the fear of judgement and idealistic beauty standards are the driving force behind how we conduct ourselves, and ultimately prove our worth. The unfortunate result being, we lose the desire of self-expression or any individualistic characteristics, instead we dull ourselves down, we become anonymous and objectified by society.

        The third article,<em> The Programmed Designer</em>, by John-Patrick Hartnett, talks about ‘industry standard’ tools in design and how we, as designers, have been governed and programmed by tech companies like Apple and Adobe because of the vast power they have over the ‘working practices’ of designers. The author goes on to explain how we, as designers have the responsibility to take back our autonomy and change the rhetoric from being ‘locked out from ownership’ to one of freedom, knowledge and the agency of the individual, of self-expression. Being governed is a societal and political construct that has been normalised from a young age. We don’t know any different, we’ve been moulded to the standards and expectations of autonomous structures and panels of people with the mechanisms of control. Fast track to 2022, we still have the same struggles, but society is beginning to change. The power lies within the voice of the people, so long as we continue to break down the walls that continue to keep us out.
